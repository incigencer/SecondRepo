# The Ultimate Number Guessing Game (UNGG)
You can specify the desirable amount of guesses. Your score will be calculated out of 100, you'll lose points for every wrong guess. The range will be updated automatically, which makes your experience easier (girl it's just a stupid game don't make it dramatic lol). The game runs in a loop, so there's no need to restart the code each time (woah, genius). Anyway, first repo on GitHubâ€”enjoy! <3
